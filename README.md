This project was made by [David](https://github.com/dvd-22/) to solve a very specific problem. Have you ever had to manually grade an exam? Whether it's yours or someone else's, it is always a pain to do it. So I created this simple website. While it is simple at the moment, I'm thinking on new ways to make this an actual project that even helps teachers grade exams by sharing a link to a answer sheet. I'm working on this slowly but surely, so any contributions are welcome!
